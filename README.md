# Deep-Learning-Image-recognition
Image recognition with deep learning neural network ( Based on the Linkedin Tutorial -Deep Learning)


Image recognition system uses deep learning neural networks that are trained to predict images based on the data sets from the CIFAR10 data sets. Consists of 60,000 images of 10 different classes of images.




Run


1.Running the file.


2.Download the entire project


3.Run the neural network training file


4.Then run "making predictions" file 



Make sure the images are in the same directory to get the predicitons. 

Can try changing line #31 of "making predicitons" file to predict different images availabe within this folder 'or' can download manually from cifar10 dataset for the rest of the datas


Example:
img = image.load_img("car.png", target_size=(32, 32))   ->   img = image.load_img("frog.png", target_size=(32, 32))
